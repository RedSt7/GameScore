General Description

The solution has been built with Java 17. It was made with the minimum libraries needed.
(I don't remember the last time I didn't use the Spring framework :) )
It follows a service->dao->entity project structure for simplicity.
It could probably be made with fewer data structures, for example, just a sorted ArrayList, but I tried to make it faster.
I also introduced basic thread safety measures like synchronized.

Hope to hear from you soon.
